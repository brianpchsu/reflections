How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

This is convenient!

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

I can compare my file and easily make version back if something bad happens. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

Pros: I control it. 
Cons: Maybe have too big or too small commit. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

The purpose is different. Git is more like programmer oriented while Google Docs is for general typing purpose. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log to check all the git history in the folder
git diff to compare two version of files


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

I will feel more confident to change anything because I can roll it back. 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
To code as much as possible! Yeah~
